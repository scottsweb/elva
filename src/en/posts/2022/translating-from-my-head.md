# What it is Versus What I Wanted

Setting up my own site should be great, right? I have things I want to do, or share, or say, and I want a way to put them online so people can find it.

The issue is, well, mostly me. I have so many ideas and end up researching so much around the _system_ to use that I forget about how I want to use it. Even more irritating, I also end up stalling on the content side of things as well. That's more from the platform I chose than anything, and not due to the platform itself!

I think what I run into a lot is a problem where I want to say something but either have a partly-thought-out idea, or something short that isn't worth the effort and overhead of writing up the way I wanted to share.

Current setup (and the last couple of iterations) have been SSGs. It's great because I can host through [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) and it's really fast. It's not-as-great in that I'm not as solid on setting up my environment to manage the site and the content. I've got it working, but not _working_ for me.

Maybe I'll look at publishing using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) instead. It would tie into the setup I'm used to (including backlinks and Markdown formatting), and is almost what I'm using to write on a daily basis anyway.

The irony? I wrote this note out in full in less than fifteen minutes. That's gotta be a personal record for writing an entry.
