## Getting Started

Make a directory and navigate to it:

```
mkdir my-site-name
cd my-site-name
```

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/scottsweb/elva.git .
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run Eleventy for site development. View the site at `http://localhost:8080`:

```
npm run dev
```

Generate a production-ready build to the `dist` folder:

```
npm run build:prod
```

You can set the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` in your hosting control panel too and use `npm run build` as before.

To use [Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/), install [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and enable the extension (if it doesn't enable automatically). It will open each time you launch your project.

## Personalisation Checklist

- [ ] In `.eleventy.js` you'll see some dynamic settings for `url`, `isProduction` and `isStaging` (under `Global Settings`). Make sure these environment variables are set in staging and production and tweak as necessary
- [ ] Configure your sites settings in `/content/_data/settings.json` or in Front Matter CMS (under Data)
- [ ] Add your chosen languages ([the demo site will soon guide you through this](https://elva.scott.ee/en/writing/adding-additional-languages/))
- [ ] Configure your sites navigation in `/content/_data/navigation.js`
- [ ] Set your own default images, icons and favicon by replacing the images in `/content/assets/img/` 
- [ ] Add your content — it's easiest to do this with Front Matter CMS which exposes [all front matter](https://elva.scott.ee/en/writing/frontmatter/) in the UI
- [ ] Setup a custom template for your open graph images (`.frontmatter/scripts/opengraph-template.html`)
- [ ] Design your site by customising the CSS (`/theme/css/`), layouts (`/theme/_layouts/`) and includes (`/theme/_includes/`)

### Optional

- [ ] Set your preferred image sizes and formats in `/elva/config/image.js`
- [ ] If you add more front matter, you may wish to edit `.frontmatter/frontmatter.json` to add [Front Matter CMS](https://frontmatter.codes/) support
- [ ] You many not need [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) which can be removed from `/theme/js/bundle.njk`
- [ ] Use [Eleventy Fetch](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/fetch/) to grab some API data
- [ ] If you enable Photon CDN support [familiarise yourself with these limitations](https://jetpack.com/support/site-accelerator/#limitations)
- [ ] [Enable build caching for your host](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/build-caching/)
 
### Updates

As of version 3.0 of elva, there are now separate folders for the `/theme`, your sites `/content` and elva related stuff `/elva`. The idea is to make upgrades of elva simpler by seperating frequently changed things (the theme and content) from the guts of the project. Hopefully this is helpful, but please open an issue if you would like to see further improvements made.
